# Contribution Guidelines

Please read this guide if you're interested in contributing to DX Tech Team Code Standards and Tools.  The purpose of this repo is to create an evolving and consensus-based source for the coding standards and tools that need to be horizontally aligned across teams.  

**We welcome collaboration, discussion, and contribution, from all members of our community** 

## Discussions

**Our community is a safe and friendly environment, where we support and treat each other with respect**.

We invite you to actively participate discussions and contributions. Our DX Slack dev channel is the best place to start an informal conversation about a new idea.  The discussion can migrate over to github when the originator(s) is/are ready to make the contribution.

### Contributing Process Overview
To contribute changes or new ideas on standards or tools, it's best to start a discussion in an issue first, ideally with a proposal. This allows everyone to participate and ensures that no potential implementation work is in vain. To request a new standard or tool, you can follow these steps:

 1. Create an Issue and state the purpose and need.  In addition, include any relevant links to material that will aide in a productive discussion.  Use [this template](https://github.com/russc/team-alignment/blob/master/proposal.md).
 2. Receive feedback from the community and wait for a consensus from the team supervisors.
 3. Once you have feedback and the supervisors are on board, make your changes and submit a pull request to Master.
 4. When the change is merged, we will close out the issue.
